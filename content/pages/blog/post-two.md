So now you know your current savings ratio, and you are in the process of boosting it.

In part, you are knocking 10, 20, or 30 years off your dependence on a job -- adding those years back to you in the form of utter freedom. Great!

Now, let’s uncover the hidden side of a few common occurrences:

1.  A 15 mile drive or bus ride to work

2.  A casual $100 shopping spree during the month

3.  Restaurant and bar spending of $150 each week

4.  Purchasing a new car financed at $330/mo

Before understanding the hidden green, you may see these like this:

1.  Oh, that’s about $3.50 each way.

2.  I know, but those shoes are so sick! I had to get ‘em.

3.  Yep, that’s $150/wk, duh.

4.  Sounds like $330/mo. I’m guessing it’s probably a little more.

This is how a huge mass of our population sees them. But we’re different here. Here’s how we see them:

### **1. A 15 mile drive or bus ride to work**

Oh, good thought! That’s around $3.50 each way or $7 a day. So it’s $35 a week. (From a couple neat calculations explained below,) I see that’s $26,320 of driving in ten years!

You know, I could totally bike that bus ride and stash that $26,320. Heck, even if I drive half and bike half I’m adding $13,160 back to my stash.

Or, I know a couple peeps at work who live near by. I’ll pick a meet up spot, shoot out an email to co-workers, and set up a carpool. If I get 3 peeps involved, I’m adding $19,740 back to my stash! And, I get 3 new friends!

### **2. A casual $100 shopping spree during the month**

That’s a closet full of $17,300 in new shoes, clothes, and half-used bathroom products in ten years!

Goodness, I don’t really need this stuff. They’re all just rogue purchases anyways.

**If I really want something, I’ll make sure it fits within my savings ratio first. And if it fits, it ain’t no thing! I’ll get it! If it doesn’t, I can totally wait a month. And if I really want it at that point, I can grab it then.** Thanks for the $17,300, self!

### **3. Restaurant and bar spending of $150 each week**

Holy smokes. That’s $112,800 of toilet flushes in ten years!

I could totally cut out the work lunches and weekend brunches. And I could definitely organize grub-nights at my place, picnics at the beach or BBQs in the park. But there’s a time or so each week where I do enjoy grabbing some grub, a coffee, or a beer at spots with my friends. Let’s give myself $30.

The difference goes right in my stash. And in 10 years, I’m saying, “Hello, $90,240 dollars!” Boom, boom!

### **4. Purchasing a 2016 Toyota Highlander financed at $330/mo**

$330/mo? Anytime something that expensive is showing a monthly payment, there's got to be something missing.

Ok, it is a $30,000 list price, $2,700 in taxes, and $2,800 in registration. That’s $35,500. Sheez! And we haven’t even got to insurance and gas.

With just a quick guess, I’ll be driving somewhere around 10,000 miles a year and definitely want the car for 5 years. That’s 50,000 miles. I’m grabbing a 2005 Toyota Matrix with 90k miles for $6,000. I’ll save $29,000 right off the bat. And in 10 years that savings itself will have packed $57,000 on to my freedom stash!

**If these four occurrences were you, and you made these changes -- we just added $190,860 to your wallet in 5 minutes!**

You see, everything costs way, way more than the price tag shows.

So here’s the magic tool: **When you’re looking at something, see how much stashing the money will give you rather than getting the item. To see this:**

*   **Multiply any weekly purchase by 752**

*   **Multiply any monthly purchase by 173**

Here’s one way I put this to play. After I surf with friends, we often grub at this Mexican spot. As I walk up to order, I see a super burrito and a Coke for $12. And I see two tacos and a water cup for $5.

I choose the two tacos and agua for $5. As I walk from the register, I literally pull my phone out and transfer $7 over to my savings.

I have an absolute killer time chilling with my bru’s each week. And I’m also stoked because in 10 years I’ll have $5,264 more in my freedom stash.

So now you know the hidden cost of everything. Go use the Rule of 752 and 173, and start adding to your freedom stash!
